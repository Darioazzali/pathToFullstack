My path to become a Fullstack developer

## How to use
The client folder conatins the react app that it's served by the express server in the server folder.  
Simply go in the server folder and run   
`npm run dev`  
to start the service with nodemon.
The application is a MERN stack, so use Mongodb as database.
Don't forget to edit the [env_sample](server/.env_sample) file that should link to your database:  
1. Substituite your *MONGO_PASSWORD* with the link to your database
2. Rename the [.env_sample](server/.env_sample) to .env
