My path to become a Fullstack developer

## How to use
The client folder conatins the react app that it's served by the express server in the server folder.
Simply go in the server folder and run 
`npm run dev`
to start the service with nodemon.
The application is a MERN stack, so use Mongodb as database.
Don't forget to edit the [env](server/.env) file that should link to your database.
